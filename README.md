### Prerequisite programming in node.js would be beneficial.

# ðŸš€ Getting started 

const MNEMONIC = process.env.MNEMONIC
const API_KEY = process.env.NODE_KEY

Clone this repo. 
Run `npm install` in terminal.
* Place Matic RPC node key and Wallet Mnemonic in new .env file
* Upload some nft metadata to an api. I used IPFS.
* Place link to NFT Collection.json in contractURI method, under GameItem.sol. 
* Deploy the contracts with `truffle develop` then `migrate --network mumbai` in the terminal, then copy the contract address.
* Add your account address, contract address and token json link to the mint script.
* Enter `node scripts/mint.js` into the console to mint.
* For security reasons my files with my private keys have been deleted as well as the hashes of my images and my json files.

### A simple way to create NFT smart contracts and deploy on OpenSea to make our digital asset visible.
 ### Good work!ðŸ™‚
